### Project Overview: Plug-and-Play Network Security System

We aim to develop a simple, user-friendly network security system using a Raspberry Pi. Our system will function similarly to a firewall, acting as a bridge between a user's internet connection and their devices to monitor and secure data traffic. We are designing this solution for individuals who are not technically proficient, providing a plug-and-play experience with minimal setup and maintenance.

### Objectives

- **Ease of Use:** Our system should be easy to install and configure, requiring minimal technical knowledge.
- **Security:** We will provide robust network security by monitoring incoming and outgoing traffic, blocking malicious activities, and preventing unauthorized access.
- **Scalability:** Our system should be scalable, allowing for additional security features or updates over time.
- **Cost-Effective:** Our solution should be affordable, utilizing readily available and inexpensive hardware and open-source software.

### System Components

#### Hardware

1. **Raspberry Pi (Model 3B+ or 4B recommended):** The central processing unit for our system.
2. **MicroSD Card (32GB or higher):** Storage for the operating system and software.
3. **Power Supply (5V, 2.5A or higher):** To power the Raspberry Pi.
4. **Ethernet Cables:** To connect the Raspberry Pi between the internet source (modem/router) and the host device (PC, laptop, etc.).
5. **Enclosure/Case for Raspberry Pi:** To protect the hardware and provide a clean aesthetic.

#### Software

1. **ISO:** Linux ISO flavor with easy networking capabilities (TBD).
2. **Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW):** A user-friendly frontend for iptables, which will manage the firewall rules.
3. **Suricata:** An open-source network threat detection engine capable of real-time intrusion detection.
4. **Pi-hole:** A DNS sinkhole that will block ads and malicious domains, enhancing security.
5. **OpenVPN/WireGuard:** To provide secure remote access if needed.
6. **Web Interface (optional):** A simple, intuitive web interface for users to monitor the system's status and make basic adjustments.

### Project Workflow

#### 1. **Hardware Setup**
   - Assemble the Raspberry Pi with the necessary components (microSD card, power supply, Ethernet cables, and enclosure).
   - Flash the Raspberry Pi OS Lite onto the microSD card using a tool like Balena Etcher.

#### 2. **Software Installation**
   - **Initial Setup:**
     - Boot up the Raspberry Pi and configure the OS (set up SSH, change default passwords, etc.).
   - **Install and Configure UFW:**
     - Install UFW and set up basic firewall rules to allow necessary traffic and block suspicious or malicious traffic.
     - Configure UFW to log and report traffic incidents.
   - **Install Suricata:**
     - Set up Suricata to monitor network traffic and detect potential threats.
     - Configure Suricata to work in IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) mode, actively blocking malicious traffic.
   - **Install Pi-hole:**
     - Install Pi-hole to filter out ads and block access to known malicious domains.
     - Integrate Pi-hole with Suricata for enhanced domain-level security.
   - **Set Up Bridge Mode:**
     - Configure the Raspberry Pi to operate in bridge mode, sitting between the internet source and the host device, transparently monitoring and filtering traffic.
   - **Optional - Install VPN Software:**
     - Install OpenVPN or WireGuard to enable secure remote access to the system.
     - Configure VPN for minimal user interaction and easy access.

#### 3. **Testing and Debugging**
   - Test the system in a controlled environment to ensure it correctly monitors and filters traffic.
   - Simulate different attack scenarios to verify the effectiveness of Suricata and UFW in detecting and blocking threats.
   - Debug any issues that arise during testing, ensuring the system is stable and reliable.

#### 4. **Web Interface Development (Optional)**
   - If desired, develop a simple web interface that allows users to view logs, adjust basic settings (e.g., enabling/disabling the firewall), and receive alerts about detected threats.
   - Ensure the web interface is secure, with authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access.

#### 5. **User Documentation**
   - Create a comprehensive user manual that guides users through the setup process, explains how the system works, and provides troubleshooting tips.
   - Include a quick start guide for users who prefer minimal reading.

#### Resources:
- **Programming Languages:** Python (for scripting), HTML/CSS (for the web interface)
- **Networking Knowledge:** Understanding of IP addressing, subnetting, and routing
- **Security Concepts:** Familiarity with firewall rules, intrusion detection systems, and secure network practices
- **Community Forums and Documentation:** Raspberry Pi Forums, UFW/Suricata documentation, etc.

### General Project Direction

1. **Prototyping:** Start by setting up the Raspberry Pi and configuring the basic software components (OS, UFW, and Suricata). Test the systemâ€™s ability to monitor and filter traffic.
2. **Iterative Development:** Gradually introduce additional features like Pi-hole and optional VPN capabilities. Test and refine the system after each major component is added.
3. **User Experience Focus:** Develop a streamlined setup process with a focus on ease of use. This may include automating certain configurations and providing clear instructions.
4. **Finalization:** Once the system is stable and user-friendly, finalize the design, create comprehensive documentation, and consider a pilot test with non-tech-savvy users for feedback.
5. **Deployment and Support:** Prepare the system for broader deployment, including post-deployment support for users.

### Next Steps

- **Assemble the necessary hardware components.**
- **Flash the Raspberry Pi OS onto the microSD card and perform the initial setup.**
- **Install and configure UFW, Suricata, and Pi-hole.**
- **Test the system in various scenarios to ensure reliability and security.**
- **Develop optional features, including the web interface and VPN setup.**
- **Create user documentation and perform a user experience test with non-tech-savvy individuals.**

Our project, once complete, will provide a robust, cost-effective, and user-friendly network security solution for users who may not have the technical expertise to manage their own network security.
